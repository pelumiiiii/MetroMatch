Goals of this project is to create a Music recognition software that provides enthusiasts with dynamic features to improve the quality of their lifestyle.

Feature List:
Dynamic Metronome: provides a BPM, volume and Pitch(0-2000hz) sliders. Also another slider for setting a time signature. default is 4/4; ranging from 1/4 to 7/8. Extra features(check boxes for activation) in developer mode would be a dynamic bpm option, a swing feature, and polyrhythm features.

Creating a history menu on bpm based on cache data

Understanding auto-sync; Fix now playing function

prompt:

There the metronome(dynamic) and the MetroMatch - song bpm matcher. Each section of the project should be accesses through a minimal mamburger menu that dropsdown to access each feature.
